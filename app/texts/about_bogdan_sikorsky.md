# About me

The photo of that beautiful landscape above is taken from my apartment. I live in Kyiv and there are so many things to love it for. It is a bit hard time and sometimes it is loud outside even though there were not too many thunderstorms this season.

Whatever happens, we will still go for morning coffee and then to our jobs because this is the only way to improve tomorrow.

I'm a Data engineer and I work completely remotely. This is my second profession and I dedicated completely to it for several years now. I had an interest in programming since I was a teenager but there were so many other interesting things. I'm always open to new challenges and interesting projects.

# Background

I have been a Software Developer for 4 years now. I learned Python and everything by myself with only a laptop by my side. I don't have any technical education but this is but that doesn't stop me from progressing in my IT career and my skills.

I never worked in the local IT market. There was no any chance that someone would hire me without proper education and confirmed skills. So I started in 2020 as a freelance on UpWork which gave me a chance to work with a foreign audience. For more than a year I had different irregular clients with very simple tasks like creating a scraping script or transforming and cleaning data but that was enough to learn.

In two recent years, I occupied a position as a Data Engineer in a US company from the real estate market. I worked as an independent contractor but it was a full-time job basically 40 working hours per week. During that time I boosted my skills significantly in comparison to where I were before. It was a good experience. Since then I had a break for half of the year because 4 recent years were quite a journey for me.

Now I'm ready to move forward and this website is proof of that.

# Fun fact

I have a good friend who retired from the army in 2023. He had some technical background but was very far from computer science.

Last fall he asked me to help him dive into Python. I wasn't thinking any minute and agreed immediately. I was mentoring him for a while, I gave him some tasks and explained some stuff.

This summer he passed an exam for the best Masters Data Science program in the whole country and recently started his course. I'm very proud and glad that I participated. This is another mention that there are no limits if you make an effort.

# Interests

I've been a great fan of Formula 1 for as long as I can remember myself. My favourite team is McLaren. While others won by supreme machinery McLaren boys always delivered results thankfully to their team spirit.

Believe it or not, I'm a fan of football and it is by far sport #1 in Ukraine but for many years I've been playing basketball. I even founded my own amateur basketball team with my friends and we were playing for 5 consecutive years in different tournaments. Unfortunately, our series has come to an end this summer but I hope we'll play again later.

I have a silly dream of acting in a movie or theatre someday. I haven't decided yet. At least I've already been a news presenter on the radio and a reporter on TV, so why not? Or should I rather record my own music album?
