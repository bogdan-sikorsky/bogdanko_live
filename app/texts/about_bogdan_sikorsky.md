# About me

The beautiful landscape you see above is a view from my apartment in Kyiv. I love this city for so many reasons, despite the challenging times we're going through. Life here can be unpredictable, and it gets loud outside sometimes, though the thunderstorms have been surprisingly rare this season.

Whatever happens, we carry on here — we still go for our morning coffee and head to work, because that’s how we create a better tomorrow.

As for me, I’m a Data Engineer working remotely. It's my second career, but one I've been fully dedicated to for the past few years. My interest in programming started in my teenage years, although life took me down different paths first. Now, I’m constantly on the lookout for new challenges and exciting projects.

# Background

I’ve been a Software Developer for four years, all self-taught. With nothing more than a laptop and determination, I dove into Python and never looked back. While I don’t have a formal technical education, that hasn’t stopped me from advancing in my IT career and honing my skills.

Starting out, I couldn’t break into the local IT market due to my lack of formal qualifications and up until now still never worked with domestic companies. So, in 2020, I turned to UpWork and began freelancing, mainly for international clients. I worked on small projects — web scraping scripts, data transformation, and data cleaning tasks. Those early jobs, though simple, were invaluable learning experiences.

For the past two years, I worked as a Data Engineer for a U.S.-based real estate company. I was an independent contractor but essentially worked full-time, logging 40 hours a week. During that time, my skills grew exponentially. It was a pivotal experience for me. After taking a break, I’m now ready for my next step, and this brand-new website is proof of that.

# Fun fact

I have a close friend who retired from the army in 2023. While he had some technical background, he was quite removed from the world of computer science. Last fall, he approached me for help learning Python. Without hesitation, I agreed and mentored him for several months, assigning tasks and guiding him through the basics.

This summer, he passed the entrance exam for the best Master's in Data Science program in our country and has just begun his studies. I’m incredibly proud to have played a part in his journey. It’s a reminder that there are no limits when you put in the effort.

# Interests

I’ve been a Formula 1 fan for as long as I can remember, and McLaren is my favorite team. While other teams may win through superior machinery, McLaren has always achieved success through sheer team spirit, and that resonates with me.

Believe it or not, I'm a fan of football and it is by far sport #1 in Ukraine but for many years I've been playing basketball. In fact, I founded an amateur basketball team with friends, and we competed in various tournaments for five years. Sadly, our run came to an end this summer, but I hope we’ll reunite for more games in the future.

One of my more unusual dreams is to act in a movie or theatre someday. I’ve already been a news presenter on the radio and a TV reporter, so why not give acting a shot? Or maybe I should focus on recording my own music album — who knows?
