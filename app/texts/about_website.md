# Technical stack

This website is based on the Streamlit framework. I used Docker and Docer-Compose for automation. Traefic control trafick behind. The application lives on an AWS server but could be transferred anywhere very easily since I have GitHub workflow so I don't need to manage the deployment process by hand.

Soon I will find some time to describe everything in depth.

Contact me if have any questions.
